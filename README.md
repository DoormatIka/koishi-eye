## what is this?

<<<<<<< HEAD
This tool finds duplicate images from a folder and identifies similar ones from images you provide.

It doesn't do anything clever at the moment, however there are plans to make this efficient and more user-friendly.
=======
**koisee** is a small, experimental tool that helps you find duplicate or similar images in folders.

she's still learning, so she isn't available yet... please wait warmly while she's preparing

## future...

koisee wants to:

- support gifs, videos and audio
- becoming faster and less memory intensive
- learn how to use profilers and flamegraphs for the above...

though images are the main focus!
