## what?

This tool finds duplicate images from a folder and identifies similar ones from images you provide.

This is a work-in-progress.
I'm currently testing out different methods to make the program handle a large amount of images.

## future.

I may end up supporting gifs, videos, and audio.
However my primary focus are images and optimizing it somehow. I am not adept in using profilers and flamegraphs yet.
